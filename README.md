UPDATE
______
New feature available, you can easily duplicade The Provider Module for create a new module with all generic code.
This line Command will rename all the file with PSR-0 friendly, and folder too. All generic file will be modified with namespace and class names
This lineCommand is not tested yet for module with name like MyModule. Only module with one Words are tested.
